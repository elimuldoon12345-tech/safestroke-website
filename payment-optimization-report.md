  requestPayerName: true,

});

// Card Payment Element

  }
});
```

## Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in Netlify:
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Your Stripe secret key
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - For webhook handling
- `SUPABASE_URL` - Database URL
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` - Database service key

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Immediate Tests
1. ✅ Load booking page - no console errors
2. ✅ Start booking flow - payment methods restricted
3. ✅ Complete test payment - success flow works
4. ✅ Check express checkout - appears on eligible devices

### Monitor for 24 Hours
- Payment success rate
- Any customer complaints about missing payment methods
- Express checkout usage statistics
- Error rates in Stripe Dashboard

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, rollback is simple:
```bash
# Restore original files
cp booking-payment-fix-backup.js booking-payment-fix.js
cp booking-single-lesson-fix-backup.js booking-single-lesson-fix.js

# Update HTML to load original scripts
# (Edit safestroke-booking.html)

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "revert: rollback payment optimization"
git push origin main
```

## Performance Impact

- **Page Load**: Minimal impact (same Stripe.js library)
- **Payment Flow**: Potentially faster (fewer options to load)
- **Conversion**: May improve with simpler checkout
- **Express Checkout**: Significantly faster for eligible users

## Security Considerations

- ✅ PCI compliance maintained (Stripe Elements)
- ✅ No sensitive data stored locally
- ✅ Server-side payment intent creation
- ✅ Webhook signature verification in place

## Support Documentation

A: We've streamlined our checkout to accept all major credit and debit cards, plus Apple Pay and Google Pay for faster checkout.

**Q: Why can't I see Apple Pay?**

A: Google Pay appears in Chrome browser when you have a saved payment method in your Google account.

**Q: Can I still use Klarna/Afterpay?**

## Conclusion

The payment optimization has been successfully implemented with:
- ✅ Card payments (always available)

- ❌ All other payment methods removed

The implementation maintains security, improves user experience with express checkout options, and simplifies the payment flow by removing unnecessary payment methods.
