## How to Edit Program Content

### To update program descriptions:
1. Open `index.html`
2. Find the program card you want to edit (search for "Droplet Card", "Splashlet Card", or "Strokelet Card")
3. Update the text within the respective sections

### To modify Strokelet Level 1/2 content:
1. Search for `id="level1-panel"` or `id="level2-panel"`
2. Edit the content within those divs
3. The tabs automatically handle switching between levels

### To change prices:
Look for the chip with the price icon and update the text:
```html
<span>From $XX/lesson</span>
```

## Accessibility Features
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading hierarchy (h2 > h3 > h4)
- **ARIA roles**: Tabs have proper `role="tab"` and `role="tabpanel"`
- **Keyboard navigation**: Arrow keys work for tab navigation
- **Focus indicators**: Visible focus rings on interactive elements
- **Minimum touch targets**: 44px minimum hit area on mobile
- **Color contrast**: AA compliant text contrast ratios

## Mobile Optimizations
- Single column layout on screens < 768px
- Chips wrap gracefully without overflow
- Text remains readable at 320px minimum width
- No horizontal scrolling
- Adequate padding and spacing for touch

## Analytics Tracking
Each CTA button includes a `data-cta` attribute for tracking:
- `data-cta="programs_droplet_details"`
- `data-cta="programs_splashlet_details"`
- `data-cta="programs_strokelet_details"`

## Browser Compatibility
- Tested on modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Uses Tailwind CSS via CDN

- Progressive enhancement approach

## Future Improvements
